Unlocking multiple disks
========================

In some circumstances, clevis(-initramfs) will not unlock all devices
needed for boot. In that case, consider adding the "initramfs" option
to /etc/crypttab for any device that is not handled automatically. (And
don't forget to run update-initramfs afterwards.)

See crypttab(5) for details, and #1000648 for a situation where this
was needed.
